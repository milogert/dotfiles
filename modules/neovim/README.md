# Neovim Module

Contains my neovim configuration.

# Features

- Useful plugins
  - Most come from the nixpkgs repository.
  - There exists a file of custom plugins which are not in nixpkgs.
- Fully configured LSP
  - Some LSs are installed from nixpkgs. The are installed by Mason.nvim.
- [Srcery](https://srcery.sh) theme.
- Directory browser is `dirvish.vim`. It makes the directories act like a vim
  buffer. No popups or anything
- Searcher is `fzf.lua`. I found telescope to be slow and I lost patience with
  it.
- Statusbar is by `heirline.nvim`. It's a highly configurable plugin and works
  great for me.
- Pretty quick startup time. Currently measured once at ~240ms. That's more
  than fast enough for me. I pretty much start it once per tmux instance and
  leave it open.

# No Nix? No Problem!

You can copy the entire config directory into `~/.config/nvim/` and just use it
as a standard neovim config.

Then call

```lua
require('milogert.main').setup({
  -- This is unused currently.
  nix = false,

  debuggers = {
    elixir_ls = "path/to/elixir_ls",
    vscode_js = {
      adapter = "path/to/vscode_js_debug_adapter",
      debugger = "path/to/vscode_js_debugger",
    },
  },

  -- Not including any of these will just disable that language server.
  ls_cmds = {
    cssls = { "bin/command", ...args },
    elixirls = { "bin/command", ...args },
    eslint = { "bin/command", ...args },
    html = { "bin/command", ...args },
    jsonls = { "bin/command", ...args },
    lua_ls = { "bin/command", ...args },
    nil_ls = { "bin/command", ...args },
    stylua = { "bin/command", ...args },
    tailwindcss = { "bin/command", ...args, },
    terraformls = { "bin/command", ...args },
    texlab = { "bin/command", ...args },
    ts_ls = { "bin/command", ...args, },
  },
})
```

## Caveats

- My plugin manager is Nix, as a result I have no plugin manager installed. You
  will want one.
- You will need to install treesitter parsers by modifying the `treesitter.lua`
  file.

# Screenshots

It's a text editor. Mostly just black-ish screens.

## Plugins

Oh boy. Probably too many.
