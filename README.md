# Usage

This probably isn't useful to anybody but me, but here you go:

## First run

```bash
HOSTNAME=your_host_name make config
```

## Subsequent runs

After the first run `HOSTNAME` will be set on the system, so you can just run

```bash
make config
```

Make sure to restart your shell or tmux session if you haven't after the first
run. Otherwise the `HOSTNAME` environtment variable will still not be set

## Updating the flake.lock for new versions

```bash
make update
```

## Just install the requirements (mostly for `nix-darwin`)

```bash
make install_requirements
```

# Why Nix?

@rpearce turned me onto this. I used to be an Arch Linux guy, but configuring
it got tiresome since I'd change things and I forgot what I changed but
magically things started working.

Nix solves that for me so if I mess something up I can just roll back to a
previous generation.

# Your computer names?

- `theseus` - this computer was `apollo`, but I replaced all the guts while
  the case remained the same.
- `rig` - formerly `pig` but now it's remote, so **R**emote P**ig**.
- `worktop` - my work laptop. It's a Mac, so it uses `nix-darwin`.
